//Getters/Setters on all properties
//All concrete and virtual methods that have non-void return types.
//3 of your concrete classes exhibit at least at least 2 expected behaviors from a parent/base class.

//Using all 4 of the Object Oriented Principles(OOPs) :

//Build out the hierarchical class structure of the vehicles within a dealership within Visual Studio and a digital diagram.

//There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 5 different types of vehicles.

//Prove that the OOP principles are being used by returning strings as necessary to prove that methods were property implemented or inherited.

//Include the following labels:

//Label the parent and derived classes
//Label the abstract classes and concrete classes
//Label the access modifiers for each of the classes
//Label where you are using Polymorphism in your program.Where are the 
//    virtual and abstract methods defined, and where are they being overridden?
